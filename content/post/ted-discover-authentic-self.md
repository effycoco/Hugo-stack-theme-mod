这是一篇积累词汇和短语表达的笔记。所用材料为 TED 演讲 —— [How to Discover Your Authentic Self -- at Any Age | Bevy Smith ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vqnazqmceQ)。

我原来是用纸笔记这样的笔记，但通常记过不会再回顾。后来是放到 Anki 卡片里面，但过程略繁琐，卡片的形式不够灵活，而且同一来源的卡片是分散的。现在开始试试做这样的笔记，方便统一回顾。然后可以有选择地放进 Anki 里。

Lessons my mother Lolly taught me.

Lolly's No.1 lesson: don't settle

my prime earning years

<hr>

she married, but she **kept her maiden name**

指婚后保留原姓氏

**maiden** n. a young girl, or a woman who is not married

<hr>

I believe today at the age of 94, my mom is still **carving out** ways to find and define her own version of happiness.
**carve out**: to develop a career or position for yourself by working hard

<hr></hr>

she **maintains** her home exactly as she **sees fit**

maintain her glamour, her sex appeal

魅力、性感

<hr></hr>

I really hope some of that **rubs off on** me

**rub off**: If a quality or characteristic that someone has rubs off, other people begin to have it because they have been with that person and learnt it from them

_His enthusiasm is starting to rub off **on** the rest of us._

<hr></hr>

Black don’t crack 指黑人不容易有皱纹

People of African descent tend to wrinkle less with age than people with fairer skin.

<hr></hr>

the time when women were really **coy** about their age

shy

<hr></hr>

You may not tell your age, but your hands and your neck will. So **make peace with aging**, or prepare for **an entire wardrobe of** gloves and **turtlenecks**.

坦然面对衰老

Someone's **wardrobe** is the total collection of clothes that they have.

**turtleneck**: 高领毛衣 =turtleneck sweater

<hr></hr>

Settling is very **insidious**. It keeps us dancing on this string, waiting for this elusive, better day to **miraculously** appear.

**insidious**: an insidious change or problem spreads gradually without being noticed, and causes serious harm; If something is **slowly and secretly causing harm**, it's *insidious* — like the rumors no one seems to listen to until suddenly someone's reputation is ruined.

**miraculous**: very good, completely unexpected, and often very lucky

(等待虚幻的好日子奇迹般自动出现好像是在说我)
