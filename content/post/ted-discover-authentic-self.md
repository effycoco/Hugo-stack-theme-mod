这是一篇积累词汇和短语表达的笔记。所用材料为 TED 演讲 —— [How to Discover Your Authentic Self -- at Any Age | Bevy Smith ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vqnazqmceQ)。

原来是用纸笔记这样的笔记，但通常记过不会再回顾。后来是放到 Anki 卡片里面，但过程略繁琐，卡片的形式不够灵活，而且同一来源的卡片是分散的。现在开始试试做这样的笔记，方便统一回顾。有需要时可以把部分放进 Anki 里。

形式为一段第一句是引用，余下部分是引用部分涉及的点，列表为这个点的延伸（释义、例句等）。
